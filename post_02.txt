I used to believe the 3 PM slump was a normal part of the workday. I'd fight it with another cup of coffee and sheer willpower, which only led to burnout. The real culprit wasn't my work ethic; it was my lunch. A high-carb, processed meal was spiking my blood sugar and leading to an inevitable crash, destroying my afternoon productivity. My performance was being dictated by my plate.

The practical takeaway was a non-negotiable shift in fuel: I replaced refined carbs and sugar with protein, healthy fats, and greens. This stabilized my energy levels throughout the day. Performance isn't just about managing your calendar; it's about managing your biology.

What's your biggest energy drain during the workday?
