Confidence on a sales call isn't improvised; it's manufactured. Too many reps spend hours researching a prospect but zero time preparing their own mindset. They enter a high-stakes conversation scattered, reactive, and tense. The result is a conversation driven by the prospect, not by a strategic advisor. Your mental and emotional state is the invisible variable that dictates the outcome of the call. You cannot lead a client from a position of internal chaos.

The takeaway is to build a simple, repeatable pre-call ritual. Before you dial, take five minutes. Stand up, drink a glass of water, and take three deep breaths. Set a single, clear intention for the call. This small act of calibration shifts you from a passive participant to a calm, focused leader.

What's one thing you do to get in the right headspace before a big call?
